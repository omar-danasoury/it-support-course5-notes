## Malicious Software
### The CIA Traid
the CIA Traid is a guiding model to design information security policies for the workplace and also for personal environment.  
- C stands for ***CONFIDENTIALITY***, as it signifies that data is only viewable by those authorized to view it
- I stands for ***INTEGRITY***, as it denotes that data won't be manipulated or corrupted.
- A stands for ***AVAILABILITY***, which means that services remain reachable and available.
#### Confidentiality
means to keep things hidden, and only people who are authorized are able to view or edit these things.  
a good example about this is using password protection.
#### Integrity
means to keep data protected and unchanged. Hashing is used to achieve this where the hash associated with the file is will change if any manipulation happened the file. 
#### Availability
means that the information we have should be accessable to the people that should have it. This includes being prepared by backing up data to prevent data loss or the system is down. 
#### Finally
keep in mind that some attacks steal the time that you'll need to spend to get services back up and running, some steal dignity, and even material things.
