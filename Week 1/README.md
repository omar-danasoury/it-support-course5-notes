### The CIA Traid
the CIA Traid is a guiding model to design information security policies for the workplace and also for personal environment.  
- C stands for ***CONFIDENTIALITY***, as it signifies that data is only viewable by those authorized to view it
- I stands for ***INTEGRITY***, as it denotes that data won't be manipulated or corrupted.
- A stands for ***AVAILABILITY***, which means that services remain reachable and available.
#### Confidentiality
means to keep things hidden, and only people who are authorized are able to view or edit these things.  
a good example about this is using password protection.
